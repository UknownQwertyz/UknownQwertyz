-  Hi, I’m UknownQwertyz
-  I’m interested in Coding in the following Coding Languages: CSS - ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS') | .js - ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript') | .json ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file') | .sh ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script') | .html ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML') | .py ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)') | .lua ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)') | .lz ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lzip') | .ts - ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript') - .torrent ('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torrent_file') - 
-  I’m currently learning how to program in Lua, JavaScript, HTML, and JSON.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on TamperMonkey Scripts and Auto-Trader Bots for Forex.com
-  I am on here every day so I will most likely see every repository I get sent very quickly :)
-  Right now I am self-taught so my knowledge about programming isn't that much but I'm currently using an AI I made myself to help me make scripts.
-  I have been programming since the age of 13 (I'm 17 now) so I'm very familiar with multiple programming languages but have been needing help because like most programmers, I have started out doing simple codes like CSS changes using Inspect, Which is how I started coding and have taught myself how to start learning CSS, although I've gotten better through time, I still lack knowledge in executing scripts (i use vs code) but I am learning quickly.
